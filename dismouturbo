			"description": " Ragdoll Dismounting is a new stickman game reminiscent of some of the best old Newgrounds games from back in the golden age of the internet. Your goal is simply to dismount your stickman in the goriest, bloodiest ways possible. The more pain you cause to your stickman, the more points you earn at the end of the level. "

Any vehicle that’s powered by something (e.g. truck, motorcycle, or rocket) is almost always effective. Any prop that’s explosive or leads to speed boosts is universally effective.   "
